JS Code Club is a monthly event on the first Wednesday of the month. It's for coding and hacking on fun projects in a social setting, there are no talks.

Ideally we make an effort to ensure that there are some interesting projects available.

## Day before

### Send a reminder message:

_JS Code Club is tomorrow! Do you have a project that you want to work on with other people? Post it here!_

_As a reminder there are no talks, this is a coding event, so bring your computer and a project to work on! We'll be coding and hacking... maybe on your project, or maybe on someone else's project that you can join!_

_(TorontoJS has other types of events that include tech talks but JS Code Club is for coding in a social environment)._

### Order pizza 
More than half of those registered will no-show, so cut the number from Meetup.com at least in half. Then order about one party-size pizza per 8 people. Ask for plates and napkins for the number of people you expect (otherwise you'll get fewer than you need). Pizzaiolo nearby on Spadina is a good option.

### Confirm with the venue

Contact Jeff at Project Spaces, ask in #orgmode on Slack for the contact info.

## At event time

### Door signs
Print and post [door signs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1K2uQibQBy_EIy5HbgMrhoseHnk0WA7-85wl1G4kEjMk/edit) on outside door and by the stairs.

### Welcome slide
Display the [welcome slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18uZ8XrsLKdj6hOrUlKmsYJ0Avz-8T2Ll5th1xM-qpR4/edit) on the projector (and keep it up throughout the event).

### Table signs
It's good when people can sit near others who are doing similar things. We usually put [signs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GnxNPHRkA-GEMg5MNNu4mdAPjbwJQUrIIc0mLq8ends/edit#slide=id.g3cd207a4c5_1_0) on the tables and as people are coming in we suggest that they sit near the sign for what they're doing/using.

### Confirm that the door will stay unlocked
Ask Jeff to make sure the door locking time is at least 7 PM.

### Greet people as they arrive
There are often many new people. We try to greet them as they arrive and let them know what's going on.

### Announcements

Many people arrive late because they know there is no set agenda, so we do the announcements twice, once at the start time (6 PM) and again at around 6:20 once more people have arrived.
